### A Strava Ride/Run Recommender

## Introduction

Strava is a social network for athletes. It allows millions of users to upload there activities and maintains a profile of those activities and any associated achievements, stats, photos, and connections to other athletes.

The VEloSpark app is used to predict rides or runs that a rider/user might enjoy based on their Strava history. The app uses a clustering based approach to label an activity according to it's relative location, total distance and elevation gain. The app then uses least squares matrix factorization to get recommendations for which activities will most likely correspond with a users preferences or athletic history. Users can add themselves to the app database and upload their data.

## <a id="h1"></a> Project Scope

#### This project sets out to accomplish two things:
*   Provide users recommendations for rides or runs to do in the state of Colorado.
*   Create a nice stable interface for viewing those recommendations

If I had more time and wasn't limited in resources I might try to create a global recommender to perform the same recommendations at locations world wide. This obviously would require a more powerful cluster of backend servers, a more robust general implementation of my model and a MUCH larger dataset.
